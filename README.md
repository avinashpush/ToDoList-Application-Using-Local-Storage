Hello! This is a project that implements HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I created a to do list application that uses local storage. I implemented a dynamic task management system that allows users to add, edit, mark as done, and delete tasks,
enhancing productivity and organization.  

To load my project to a server use npx commands: npx live-server
